## Pragya Kallanagoudar

Hello! I’m a fourth-year undergraduate at UC Berkeley studying CS & philosophy. I’m very grateful to be advised by [Sarah Chasins](https://schasins.com), [Eunice 
Jun](http://eunicemjun.com), and [Rolando Garcia](https://rlnsanz.github.io).

I’m interested in human-computer interaction&mdash; particularly, in the question of how we can build kinder, fairer systems that uphold human autonomy. 
I’m especially passionate about serving under-resourced, mission-driven people and organizations through technology. 

Previously, I led and sourced projects at [Cal Blueprint](https://calblueprint.org), and taught [CS 61A](https://cs61a.org), Berkeley’s functional programming class. In August, I’ll begin work as 
a software engineer at [Headway](https://headway.co) in New York.
